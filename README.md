# IAT-psiTurk
## Features:
* This psiturk project is coded based on the jspsych stroop project at https://github.com/alexanderrich/stroop-jspsych
* Pretty much the same as the IAT task on Project Implicit: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html
* Use the JsPsych IAT example code (compatible with psiTurk) to construct the main IAT task in this project. Reference: https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/jspsych-iat-html/
* All the jsPsych plugins can be found at https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych

## To-do:
* Record data for each trial 
* Write code comments for the task.js file
